If you wanted to display all of this data on an interactive map, like a Leaflet map, it would be extremely slow to load because there is so much of it, and it's at such a high resolution. To show this data in a performant way on a map, we need to create lower resolution tiles, and they need to be in a web-accessible format (most browsers can't render GeoTIFF files, PNG is better.) - [Here is a good explanation](https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/)\n",

Only when you zoom in, and the extent is smaller, will higher resolution levels load. This scaling of resolution by zoom level is what allows us to interact with the data in a performant way.\n",
